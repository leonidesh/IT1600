1. Before the computer is assembled, we need to take all the hardware out of the box, including CPU, graphics card, memory, motherboard, hard disk, case, power supply, etc  
![one](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG40515D2.jpg)

2. First, we take out the motherboard, the motherboard looks like this, as shown in the following figure.  
![two](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG4054QF.jpg)

3. Take Intel processor as an example, AMD can also refer to the installation. We take out the CPU and complete the installation of the CPU and the motherboard. We need to pay attention to the two slots on the CPU in order to properly install it into the CPU slots on the motherboard, as shown in the figure below.  
![three](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG40559417.jpg)

4.We open the cover on the pull rod of the CPU slot on the motherboard. As shown in the figure below, we correspond the two slots of the CPU to the bumps in the CPU slot to install it correctly.

5. The grooves on the CPU are aligned with the bumps on the CPU slots on the motherboard.  
![five](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG4061a18.jpg)

6. Then we pull the lever back up and the black plastic lid pops off.  
![six](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG40630393.jpg)

7. If there is no silicone grease at the bottom of the CPU radiator, then you need to smear the silicone grease on the CPU to dissipate heat.  
![seven](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG4091LB.jpg)

8. The CPU and motherboard have been installed correctly.  
Take the original Intel fan as an example. There is silicon grease at the bottom of the radiator, and then we install the radiator. For the installation of the third-party radiator, please refer to the instructions in the radiator.
![eight](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG40931G4.jpg)

9. The original Intel radiator is fixed with plastic pin clips and holes on the motherboard, making it easy to install.  
![nine](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG4094C53.jpg)

10. After aligning the plastic pin buckle of the radiator with the four round holes of the motherboard (around the CPU slot), we press down hard in the way of Angle lines respectively to fix the CPU FAN on the motherboard, and then connect the power supply line of the radiator to the slot of the motherboard CPU FAN.  
![ten](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG40955301.jpg)

11. Let's take a look at the back of the motherboard and check if the lower radiator is properly installed. If the black plastic rod does not fully hold the white clamp open, then it is not installed in place, as shown in the picture below.  
![eleven](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG41531917.jpg)

12. Below we carry on the memory installation, the installation of memory is very simple, one memory is installed arbitrarily into the motherboard memory slot, if we need to install two memory, four memory slots, we install into the black memory slot or the white memory slot respectively, you can form a dual channel memory.  
![twelve](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG41602U9.jpg)

13. There will be a fixed buckle design on both sides of the memory slot. Before installing the memory, we need to press the buckle (there is a fixed buckle design on both sides of the memory slot, please press both sides), as shown in the figure below.  
![thirteen](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG41619457.jpg)

14. In addition, when installing the memory, we need the memory goldfinger above the gap corresponding to the memory slot on the bump, this is the anti-freeze design, the reverse can not be inserted.  
![fourteen](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG41643118.jpg)

15. The memory installation is complete, as shown in the figure below.  
![fiveteen](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG41A9538.jpg)

16. Now let's install the M.2 SSD. The motherboard can support the M.2 SSD in 2242/2260/2280 specifications.
The M.2 SSD is easy to install, insert into the M.2 slot, press down on the SSD, and screw on the SSD.  
![sixteen1](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG41Q13R.jpg)

![sixteen3](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG41952925.jpg)

17. After the SSD is installed, we take out the case and open the side panel of the case.  
![seventeen](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG420055M.jpg)

18. Before installing the motherboard to the chassis, we first found IO baffle in the motherboard box and fixed IO baffle on the chassis.  
![eighteen1](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42020951.jpg)
![eighteen2](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG4214a91.jpg)

19. The following is to fix the copper stud to the screw hole of the corresponding motherboard size, and the hole position of the motherboard corresponds to the copper stud position.  
![nineteen](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42601G1.jpg)

20. We just fix the motherboard with screws.  
![twenty](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42619507.jpg)

21. If the chassis is equipped with a chassis fan or a fan is installed, we connect the fan power supply line to the "SYS_FAN" interface of the motherboard, as shown in the figure below.  
![twenty-one](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG4263b41.jpg)

22. Next, we connect the front AUDIO interface of the chassis, which is identified as HD AUDIO, as shown in the figure below.  
![twenty-two](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42A5255.jpg)

23. Find the pre-audio pin on the motherboard (the pin corresponding to the pre-audio interface is generally marked on the motherboard). The USB2.0 interface has a similar method. The motherboard has a marked USB2.0 insert pin and you can insert it, as shown in the figure below.  
![twenty-three](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42J2A4.jpg)

24. Then find the front USB3.0 interface of the chassis, insert it into the USB3.0 slot on the motherboard, and the motherboard will have the USB3.0 logo and anti-freeze design.  
![twenty-four](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42P2X3.jpg)

25. About the motherboard jumper, respectively for POWER SW POWER switch, LED POWER+/- POWER indicator, H.D.D LED hard disk indicator, PESET SW restart, for novice installed users, this is the most difficult, because each motherboard connection is different, please refer to your motherboard manual connection, in addition to the motherboard also has a logo.  
![twenty-five1](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42QB25.jpg)
![twenty-five2](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42UcQ.jpg)
![twenty-five3](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG42910P7.jpg)

26. Finally, we are installing an independent video card. If you don't have an independent video card, please skip it. First, we open the fixed clip at the end of the video card PCI-EX16 slot, and the fixed clip will buckle automatically after the video card is installed in place.  
![twenty-six](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG4293R16.jpg)

27. We inserted the video card into the PCI-E X16 slot and fixed it with screws.  
![twenty-seven](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG429523N.jpg)

28. Finally, we install the power supply. This case adopts the lower power supply design. When we install the power supply, we need to pay attention to the direction of the power supply fan, and the correct installation method is to blow the power supply fan downward.  
![twenty-eight](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG43003649.jpg)

29. We found the 24PIN line of the power supply and inserted it into the 24PIN slot corresponding to the motherboard, as shown in the figure below.  
![twenty-nine](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG43013Z6.jpg)

30. Then find the 8PIN CPU line on the power supply (CPU identification is on the interface) and insert it into the interface near the 8PIN CPU, as shown in the figure below.If it is a slot for the 4PIN CPU on the motherboard, then the 8pin CPU wire interface can be decomposed.  
![thirty](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG43022N1.jpg)

31. Find the power supply line of PCI-E and access the external power supply line of the video card as required.  
![twenty-one](http://www.lotpc.com/uploads/allimg/180827/1-1PRG43033109.jpg)

32. The computer has been assembled, let's connect the monitor, keyboard and mouse, etc., and start to make the system for the computer.
